# Pokémon Battle Simulator (STM32 / Nucleo-F031K6)

## 🎮 Overview  
This project is a **Pokémon battle simulator** built on the STM32 Nucleo-F031K6 microcontroller using the **CMSIS framework**.  
It renders graphics to a TFT display, plays sound effects/music, and implements a turn-based combat system where the player can select moves from a menu and battle against a CPU opponent.  

The goal was to combine **embedded systems programming** with **game design mechanics**, resulting in a small-scale but fully interactive Pokémon battle experience.

## 🛠 Features  
- **Graphics Rendering** – custom low-level driver (`display.c`) to draw text, sprites, and animations on a TFT screen.  
- **Sound** – tone generation with `TIM14` timers (`sound.c`, `musical_notes.h`).  
- **Serial Communication** – UART for debugging/logging (`serial.c`).  
- **Combat System** – turn-based battle mechanics between player and CPU Pokémon.  
- **Menu Navigation** – on-screen cursor and input handling for move selection.

## 🎯 My Role  
I was responsible for **designing and coding the core gameplay mechanics**, specifically:  
- **Combat mechanics** – damage calculation, CPU move selection, attack effects, health bar updates.  
- **Menu mechanics** – move selection system, cursor navigation (`↑/↓`), and input handling.  

You can see this work mainly in:  
- [`main.c`](src/main.c) – functions like `game_loop()`, `pika_moves()`, `charm_moves()`, `cpu_choose_move_char()`, `cpu_choose_move_pika()`, and related combat logic.  
- Menu positioning macros (`INC`, `X`, `START`) and functions (`move_up_func`, `move_down_func`).
